# Unexpected Behavior with Null-Aware Operator in Dart Getter

This repository demonstrates a potential source of confusion when using the null-aware operator (`??`) in Dart getters, particularly for developers new to Dart's null safety features.

## The Bug
The code in `bug.dart` showcases a `MyClass` with a getter `myVariable`. This getter uses the null-aware operator (`??`) to return 0 if the internal variable `_myVariable` is null.  While this seems straightforward, it can lead to unexpected behavior if the initial state isn't carefully considered.

## The Solution
The solution, found in `bugSolution.dart`, shows different ways to handle the initialization to avoid potential confusion and ensure predictable behavior.  A more explicit initialization is preferred for clarity and better null-handling practices.

## How to reproduce
1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the directory
3. Run `dart bug.dart` and then `dart bugSolution.dart`
4. Observe the differences in output, highlighting the importance of correct initialization and null handling.
